A simplest form of neural network - Perceptron

It is used to linearly classify points on a graph

There are two groups of points on a matplotlib graph

1. Blue points
2. Red points

A Line f(x) segregates these two groups.

Perceptron tries to segregate these two regions by guessing a line guessedY(x).

Learning (LEANING_RATE) dictates how steep a learning curve will be for perceptron.
